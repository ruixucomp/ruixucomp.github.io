## Research Vision
<ul>
  <li>
    While the global demand for air travel continues to rise, the aerospace carbon footprint is increasingly concerning. In the near term, sustainable and carbon-neutral fuels are in high demand to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the ideal future aerospace vehicle will be integrated with highly efficient and high-power propulsion devices using clean and renewable energy sources. The design of these propulsion systems requires a fundamental understanding of high-speed flows across multiple scales, featuring interactions between the molecular scale.

    My research goal is to enable aerospace sustainability and high-speed aerospace vehicle design through multiscale reacting flow modeling. I am particularly interested in understanding sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen combustion, and the underlying low- and high-speed reacting flow physics in both current aerospace propulsion devices and future carbon-neutral, high-speed vehicles. Short-term, specific research tasks include:
  </li>
  <ol start="1">
    <li>Sustainable aviation fuel modeling and development</li>
    <li>Nonequilibrium aerothermochemistry and kinetics modeling in high-speed flows</li>
    <li>Energy materials modeling and design</li>
  </ol>    
</ul>

## Research Approach
<ul>
  <li>
    I work in the interdisciplinary area bridging quantum chemistry, chemical kinetics, fluid mechanics and gas dynamics, with the aid of machine learning and data-driven methods. I develop multiscale computational approach for reacting flows across different time and length scales, featuring interactions between the molecular scale (e.g., fast chemistry and thermal nonequilibrium) and the flow scale (e.g., shock, boundary layer, and turbulent flow).
