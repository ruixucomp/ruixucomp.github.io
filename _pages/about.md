**Welcome to my personal website!** 
* My research interest spans across the scales from molecular level first principles reaction discovery, to continuum scales chemical kinetic modeling, fluid mechanics, and materials study. 
* My goal is to leverage multiscale computations for applications including sustainable biofuel combustion modeling and design, reacting flow physics, and novel energy harvesting materials study. 
* My long term vision is to merge the borders of engineering disciplines with fundamental physical and chemical science. For more details please go to my research and publications pages.

### Bio
I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Chemistry at Stanford University, under the supervision of Prof. Todd Mart√≠nez. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University in 2019, under the advisory of Prof. Hai Wang. Before that, I earned my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University in 2014, and my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2012.
