**Welcome to my personal website!** 
<ul>
  <li>
    I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Chemistry at Stanford University, under the supervision of <a href="https://mtzweb.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todd Mart√≠nez</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University with <a href="https://nanoenergy.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hai Wang</a>.

    My research aims to establish a new understanding on high-speed reacting flow physics, through designing multiscale approaches combining ab initio molecular modeling, chemical kinetics, and turbulent flow simulations. This multiscale platform will tackle three critical problems in high-speed reacting flows, including nonequilibrium physics, sustainable aviation fuels, and plasma chemistry. My long term vision is to merge the borders of engineering disciplines with fundamental physical and chemical science.
