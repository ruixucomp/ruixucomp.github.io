**Welcome to my personal website!** 
<ul>
  <li>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC), starting in January 2025. <a href="https://www.xu-group-usc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My research group</a> is recruiting graduate students and postdocs for Fall 2025. Prospective candidates may email me (rui.ray.xu@usc.edu) with your CV and research interests.

    My <a href="/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research mission</a> is to advance <strong>sustainable and high-speed aerospace propulsion</strong> and enable <strong>clean energy transitions</strong>. My core research is to tackle two challenges in the aerospace frontier: <strong><font color="blue">aerospace sustainability</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#EE7D31">high-speed aerospace vehicle design</font></strong>. I am particularly interested in understainding <strong><font color="blue">sustainable aviation fuel</font></strong> combustion, emission, and their synthetic production pathways, along with the underlying reacting flow physics in both current aerospace propulsion devices and <strong><font color="#EE7D31">future carbon-neutral, high-speed vehicles</font></strong>. Beyond the core research mission, I am also interested in applying fast quantum chemistry for materials computation to enable future <strong><font color="green">sustainable energy materials design</font></strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    My <a href="/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research approach</a> centers around <strong>multiscale reacting flow modeling</strong>, integrating computations such as <strong><font color="#1E90FF">fast quantum chemistry computation</font></strong>, <strong><font color="#1E90FF">chemical kinetic modeling</font></strong>, and <strong><font color="#1E90FF">turbulence-resolved flow simulations</font></strong>, with the aid of <strong><font color="maroon">machine learning and data-driven methods</font></strong>. For details, please visit my <a href="/research/">research page</a>.

    Before joining USC, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University and in the PULSE Institute at SLAC National Laboratory. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University, and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. See <a href="/files/Xu_CV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV</a> for details.
