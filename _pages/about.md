    I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University. My research mission is to develop next-generation <strong>sustainable and efficient aerospace propulsion devices</strong>. My goal is to tackle two challenges in the aerospace frontier: <strong><font color="blue">aerospace sustainability</font></strong> and <strong><font color="#EE7D31">high-speed aerospace vehicle design</font></strong>. I am particularly interested in understainding <strong><font color="blue">sustainable aviation fuel</font></strong> and <strong><font color="blue">hydrogen</font></strong> combustion and its synthetic production pathways, along with the underlying reacting flow physics in both current aerospace propulsion devices and <strong><font color="#EE7D31">future carbon-neutral, high-speed vehicles</font></strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    My research approach centers around <strong>multiscale reacting flow modeling</strong>. I specialize in the development of modeling methodologies unique to reacting flow physics, such as chemical kinetics, molecular interactions, thermal nonequilibrium, and turbulent flows. To accomplish this, I integrate techniques such as GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry molecular modeling, chemical kinetic modeling, and turbulence-resolved flow simulations, with the aid of data-driven methods. <!--For details, please visit my <a href="/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research page</a>. -->

    I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University, and my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. See <a href="/files/Xu_CV_PersonalPage_0524.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV</a> for details.
