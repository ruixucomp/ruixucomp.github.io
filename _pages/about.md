Welcome to my personal website! I am a computational engineer. My experience and expertise bridge across combustion and propulsion, computational chemistry, reacting flow simulation, and materials modeling. My vision is to merge the borders of engineering disciplines with fundamental physical and chemical science. For more details please go to my research and publications pages.

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Chemistry at Stanford University, under the supervision of Prof. Todd Mart√≠nez. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University in 2019, under the advisory of Prof. Hai Wang. Before that, I earned my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University in 2014, and my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2012.
